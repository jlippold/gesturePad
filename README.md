gesturePad
==========

IR to HTTP pseudo gateway that I use to control my TV's (power/volume etc) via mobile device.

This is a phonegap application that uses gestures to control a television.

Currently controls Media Center (through metabrowser plugin), DirecTV, Eventghost. But theoretically can control any device with running a HTTP server.
